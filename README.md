## Changing the statistics

Open the file at `vendor/youth_map/youth_countries.js`. You will see the countries listed as so:

```
var numberYouth = {
    "No Country": "204",
    "af": "11",
    "al": "2",
    "dz": "2",
    "ao": "2",
    "ag": "0",
    "ar": "16",
    "am": "0",
}
```

Simply change the numbers in statistics for each country acronym. Make sure they're in quotes and in the exact format to avoid syntax errors. You can view the country codes in the documentation (here)[http://jvectormap.com/maps/world/world/].
